# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This is a simple implementation of the classic game where the user plays against the computer. The user selects one of three options—Rock, Paper, or Scissors—and the computer randomly chooses one as well. The winner is determined based on standard game rules:
## Features

- Play against the computer.
- User-friendly interface (command-line interface).
- Randomized computer moves.
- Display of results (win/loss/tie) after each round.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program using your preferred programming language environment (e.g., Python).
4. The program will prompt you to input your choice: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
5. The computer will make its choice, and the result will be displayed.
6. Play as many rounds as you'd like!

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajitashwathr10/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git
cd Rock-Paper-Scissors
```

## How To Run
Python:
- If the game is implemented in Python, you can run the game using the following command:
```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```
Other Languages:
- If the project is implemented in another programming language, simply follow the execution instructions for that language.

## **Sample Game**
Here is an example of what the game might look like when played in the terminal:
```bash
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
